## Welcome to "docker-debug-1"

This is a small example project with a goal to demonstrate how to setup a small dockerized project and debug inside the
docker container.

## Project setup

### Clone this repository

Use command to clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BorodaUA/git_actions_test.git
```

### Pre install requirements

- Install https://www.docker.com/[docker]
- Install https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker compose]
- Install https://code.visualstudio.com/download[VSCode IDE]
- Install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker&ssr=false#review-details[Docker extension]
- Install remote extensions:
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-explorer
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh-edit
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

## Setup `.env` file

### Semi automatic `.env` file setup

Use command make command to setup `.env` file.

```bash
make env_setup
```

NOTE: If you don't have `make` in your system you can follow a https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-make-on-ubuntu/[guide] how to install it, or use manual setup.

### Manual `.env` file setup

Create `.env` file in the repository root folder and copy there content of the `.env.example` file.

## Run project docker compose

### Run project docker compose with make commands

* Use make command to build and run project's docker compose
```bash
make up
```

* Use make command to restart project's docker compose
```bash
make restart
```

* Use make command to stop project's docker compose
```bash
make stop
```

* Use make command to stop and remove containers of the project's docker compose
```bash
make down
```

### Run project docker compose with manual commands

Be in the repository root folder and use following commands:

* Use docker command to build and run project's docker compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

* Use docker command to stop and remove containers of the project's docker compose
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Connect to the running container

With a running Docker container or Docker compose, open the Docker extension, right click on the container you want to connect into and select 'Attach Visual Studio Code'

image::docs/images/Docker_extension_main_page.jpg[Docker_extension_main_page]

An additional pop up window in the top middle of the screen might pop up with list of containers to select. In our case select `/example_app` container.

image::docs/images/docker_extension_container_select.jpg[Docker_extension_container_select]

A new window will show up and after short wait you will be connected to the container.

## vscode dev container configuration setup

Once you will be connected inside the container press `F1`(or equivalent for your system) and start typing: `open container conf` and select "open container configuration file"

image::docs/images/dev_container_config_pop_up.jpg[dev_container_popup]

You will open empty `.json` file

image::docs/images/dev_container_empty_config.jpg[dev_container_popup]

Edit that file with proposed configuration:

```json
{
    "workspaceFolder": "/usr/src/app", 
    "extensions": [
		"donjayamanne.githistory",
		"hbenl.vscode-test-explorer",
		"ms-python.python",
		"ms-python.vscode-pylance",
		"ms-toolsai.jupyter",
		"ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap",
		"ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers",
		"ms-vscode.test-adapter-converter"
	]
}
```

Here we setup vscode extensions that will be installed on connect to the container as well as `"workspaceFolder": "/usr/src/app"` the default folder what will be opened. Save the file manually if needed and close it.

Next step we need to bring down our docker compose with make or manual commands and start docker compose again to make sure that changes above will take effect.

## Create debug configuration .json file (Python examples)

Open Run and debug section in vscode and click create a launch.json file button.

A prompt window with supported configs will pop up this is why it is important to install python extension "ms-python.python" inside the container. 

image::docs/images/debug_config_popup.jpg[dev_container_popup]

Select Python then any configuration like "Python File".

image::docs/images/debup_conf_name_pop_up.jpg[dev_container_popup]

After that a json file with configurations will open up. This will create `.vscode` folder in the root of your `pwd` directory(in our case `/usr/src/app`).

image::docs/images/python_file_conf.jpg[dev_container_popup]

Here it is you have created your debug configuration and it is working in the file that you are currently open in the vscode.

## Add new configurations in the debug `launch.json` file.

* 1 Configuration with specific script name

```json
{
	"name": "python debug_example_1.py",
	"type": "python",
	"request": "launch",
	"program": "/usr/src/app/debug_example_1.py",
	"console": "integratedTerminal",
	"args": [],
	"justMyCode": true
}
```

This is an example of configuration to specific .py file
Debug configuration equivalent to CLI command: `python /usr/src/app/debug_example_1.py`

* 2 Configuration with specific script name and CLI arguments

```json
{
	"name": "python debug_example_cli_1.py --name=John --age=25",
	"type": "python",
	"request": "launch",
	"program": "/usr/src/app/debug_example_cli_1.py",
	"console": "integratedTerminal",
	"args": [
		"--name=John",
		"--age=25"
	],
	"justMyCode": true
}
```

This is an example of configuration to specific .py file that accepts CLI arguments.
Debug configuration equivalent to CLI command: `python /usr/src/app/debug_example_cli_1.py --name=bob --age=28`

This is how `.vscode/launch.json` looks like with all the debug configs above.

image::docs/images/debug_config_with_3_configs.jpg[debug_config_with_3_configs]

You can put as many configurations as you want; "configurations": [] is just a list with json configurations.

After the configuration setup, you will be able to run the configuration and place breakpoints to investigate and debug the code.

## Debug configuration usage examples

Go to the 'Run and Debug' section in vscode and select debug configuration you want to use.

image::docs/images/debug_config_select.jpg[debug_config_select]

### Usage example for specific `.py` file.

Select `python debug_example_1.py` configuration and open `debug_example_1.py` file than place break points in for example `greet()` func. After that run the configuration by pressing `F5`(or equivalent button for your system mac,linux etc.) or green triangle button.

image::docs/images/debug_variables_menu.jpg[debug_variables_menu]

The break points should work and the execution of the code will be suspended. Select `variables` tab in your terminal where you can expand `locals` and `globals` menus to see all the variables.

Control the execution with https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_debug-actions[Keys] to traverse through the code.


### Usage example for specific `.py` file that takes CLI arguments.

Select `python debug_example_cli_1.py --name=John --age=25` configuration and open `debug_example_cli_1.py` file than place break points in for example `greet_cli()` func. After that run the configuration by pressing `F5`(or equivalent button for your system mac,linux etc.) or green triangle button.

image::docs/images/debug_cli_with_args.jpg[debug_cli_with_args]

The break points should work and the execution of the code will be suspended. Select `variables` tab in your terminal where you can expand `locals` and `globals` menus to see all the variables.

Control the execution with https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_debug-actions[Keys] to traverse through the code.

You can change variables that you passing to the script by redacting the debug config.


## Closing notes

Debug in the docker containers with vscode requires a little bit of manual setup but the advantages is very big. I highly recommend to read https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging[official] readme on vscode debugging setup. Happy bug hunting!
